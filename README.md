# GradleEditor

Gradle Editor for Eclipse IDEs &amp; Enide Studio

Gradleware works for Gradle tools in Eclipse within Eclipse Buildship project.
And of course have plans for full pledged Editor 
(see [story](https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/stories/Editor.md))
but it is not in nearest future (please let use know via raised issue #2 when you see it on Roadmap)

The goal is to give Editor that would work within any Eclipse project, 
with or without Pivotal Gradle IDE or Eclipse Buildship integrations.
This Editor will take no Gradle APIs or Groovy dependency and stay as light as possible.

## History

This has started as Minimalist Gradle Editor within Nodeclipse-1 repository,
and was extracted by Martin Steiger request https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/issues/187
Initially it was implemented within one day by cloning on Nodeclipse JavaScript Editor.
